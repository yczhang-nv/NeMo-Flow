# Build a Plugin

Use this skill when a user wants to package reusable NeMo Relay runtime behavior
behind plugin configuration.

## Use This When

Use this skill when the behavior should be activated by shared config and reused
across applications, teams, or process startup paths.

Common cases:

- Register subscribers, guardrails, intercepts, or a small bundle of related
  runtime behavior.
- Validate operator-supplied config before changing runtime behavior.
- Give reusable behavior a stable plugin `kind` and activation lifecycle.
- Package behavior that should be enabled, disabled, or rolled out through
  plugin config rather than repeated application startup code.

## Do Not Use This When

Do not build a plugin when a narrower NeMo Relay surface is enough:

- One request or tenant needs temporary behavior -> use scope-local middleware.
- The user only needs first-time scopes, tool calls, or LLM calls ->
  `nemo-relay-instrument-calls`.
- The user only needs to choose an exporter path ->
  `nemo-relay-setup-observability`.
- The behavior depends on live callables, provider clients, file handles,
  credentials, or framework objects inside config.

## Embedded Plugin Model

- Plugins package reusable process-level behavior.
- A plugin exposes a stable `kind` string and receives component-local config
  from a shared plugin document.
- Plugin config must be JSON-compatible across Rust, Python, Node.js, files,
  tests, and deployment systems.
- Validation is deterministic and side-effect free. It inspects config and
  returns structured diagnostics before runtime behavior changes.
- Registration runs after validation and installs real behavior through
  `PluginContext`, such as subscribers, guardrails, request intercepts,
  execution intercepts, or stream execution intercepts.
- `PluginContext` gives the plugin system enough ownership to qualify runtime
  names and roll back partial setup when activation fails.
- Disabled components should still validate when possible so operators can find
  config problems before rollout.

## Default Path

1. Decide whether a plugin is actually needed. Prefer direct instrumentation or
   scope-local behavior when the use case is not reusable process-level
   behavior.
2. Pick one first runtime surface: subscriber-oriented export, sanitize
   guardrail, conditional guardrail, request intercept, execution intercept, or
   stream execution intercept.
3. Choose a stable plugin `kind` and the smallest JSON-compatible config shape.
4. Define diagnostics for missing fields, unsupported values, unknown fields,
   unsafe config, and invalid field combinations.
5. Validate config before initialization. Validation must not open network
   connections, create clients, register middleware, or mutate process state.
6. Register runtime behavior through `PluginContext`, not by hand-registering
   global behavior inside application startup.
7. Test activation, disabled components, validation failures, and registration
   failure rollback.
8. Document how to enable the plugin, what config fields are supported, and how
   to roll back the component.

## Config Shape

The top-level plugin document contains `version`, `components`, and `policy`.
Each component supplies the plugin `kind`, `enabled`, and component-local
`config`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "components": [
    {
      "kind": "redaction-policy",
      "enabled": true,
      "config": {
        "preset": "strict"
      }
    }
  ],
  "policy": {
    "unknown_component": "warn",
    "unknown_field": "warn",
    "unsupported_value": "error"
  }
}
```

Keep business logic in plugin code, not in config. Use references to secrets or
endpoints rather than embedding sensitive values.

## Binding Pointers

- Python: `nemo_relay.plugin`
- Node.js: `nemo-relay-node/plugin`
- Rust: `nemo_relay::plugin`
- Go and raw FFI are source-first or advanced surfaces.

Use the same canonical `snake_case` config keys across bindings and files. Node
helper functions can be `camelCase`, but plugin config objects remain
`snake_case`.

## Failure Modes To Avoid

- Do not put callables, clients, credentials, framework objects, file handles,
  or caches in plugin config.
- Do not perform runtime registration during validation.
- Do not skip validation for disabled components.
- Do not register directly through global startup code when `PluginContext`
  should own the runtime behavior.
- Do not combine unrelated subscribers, request transforms, and policy checks
  in the first plugin unless one config document clearly owns the bundle.
- Do not export raw production payloads or secrets. Add telemetry sanitization
  before data leaves the process.
- Do not ignore partial activation failures. Roll back or surface a clear
  diagnostic.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Stable plugin `kind` chosen.
- [ ] Config shape is JSON-compatible and uses `snake_case`.
- [ ] Required fields and unsupported values produce stable diagnostics.
- [ ] Unknown fields follow the configured policy.
- [ ] Disabled components still report config problems where possible.
- [ ] Initialization installs behavior through `PluginContext`.
- [ ] A forced registration failure does not leave partial runtime behavior
      active.
- [ ] Docs or examples show how to enable and roll back the plugin.

## Use Another Skill When

- You only need to wrap direct tool or LLM calls ->
  `nemo-relay-instrument-calls`
- You need to set up traces or exporters without packaging a plugin ->
  `nemo-relay-setup-observability`
- You need to debug plugin activation, missing events, or load failures ->
  `nemo-relay-debug-runtime-integration`
