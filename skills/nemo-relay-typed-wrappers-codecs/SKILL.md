# Use Typed Wrappers And Codecs

Use this skill when an application wants stronger domain types than raw JSON for
tool or LLM integration.

## Default Guidance

- Prefer plain JSON first for initial adoption.
- Reach for typed wrappers when the application already has stable domain models.
- Keep in mind that middleware still operates on JSON, not typed objects.

## Embedded Codec Model

- A typed value codec is a pure boundary translator. It converts
  application-facing values to JSON before NeMo Relay emits events or runs
  middleware, then converts JSON back into the framework callback or caller type.
- Python exposes `JsonPassthrough`, `DataclassCodec`, `PydanticCodec`, and
  `BestEffortAnyCodec`. Node.js exposes `JsonPassthrough` plus custom
  `Codec<T>` implementations.
- Use `BestEffortAnyCodec` only at boundaries where strict schemas are not
  available. Prefer dataclass, Pydantic, or explicit Node.js codecs when the
  framework owns a stable schema.
- Provider codecs are different from typed value codecs: they normalize
  provider-specific LLM requests and responses so middleware and subscribers can
  inspect messages, tools, model names, generation parameters, and response
  annotations.
- Built-in provider codecs include `OpenAIChatCodec`, `OpenAIResponsesCodec`,
  and `AnthropicMessagesCodec` in Python, Node.js, and Rust. Choose the
  codec that matches the actual provider payload shape.
- Response codecs annotate LLM end events with fields such as `id`, `model`,
  `message`, `tool_calls`, `finish_reason`, `usage`, provider-specific data, and
  extra unmodeled fields. They do not rewrite the caller-visible response.
- Request codecs run before LLM request intercepts. Intercepts receive both the
  raw `LLMRequest` and optional annotated request; `encode` merges annotated
  edits back before execution intercepts and the provider callback run.

## Key Rules

- Typed wrappers are currently a first-class path for Python and Node.js; Rust
  uses codec traits directly
- Request/response conversion belongs in codecs
- Intercepts and guardrails see JSON values after encoding
- Changes made by middleware survive into the decode step

## Choose A Codec

- `JsonPassthrough` for JSON-native values
- `DataclassCodec` or `PydanticCodec` in Python when the models already exist
- Custom codecs for domain-specific wire shapes
- `BestEffortAnyCodec` only when broad flexibility is worth the looser contract
- Provider codecs for LLM provider payloads, not application domain objects
  conversion

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Codec output is JSON-compatible
- [ ] Required fields survive `toJson`/`fromJson` or `decode`/`encode`
- [ ] Middleware sees the expected serialized shape
- [ ] Provider codecs preserve fields they do not understand
- [ ] Response codec failures do not break the underlying LLM call
- [ ] Request codec `encode` preserves original provider fields unless an
  intercept intentionally changes them
