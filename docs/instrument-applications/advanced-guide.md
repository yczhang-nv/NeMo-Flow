# Add Middleware

Use this guide when instrumentation is working and you want NeMo Flow to enforce policy, transform requests, wrap execution, or sanitize observability payloads around tool and LLM calls.

## What You Build

You will add middleware to an instrumented application and verify that it runs in the expected part of the pipeline:

- Request intercepts transform the real request before execution.
- Sanitize guardrails transform only the payload recorded on events.
- Conditional-execution guardrails can block execution.
- Execution intercepts wrap the callback and can add timing, retries, routing, or fallback behavior.

## Before You Start

Complete [Instrument a Tool Call](instrument-tool-call.md) or [Instrument an LLM Call](instrument-llm-call.md). Middleware only runs when the call goes through a NeMo Flow managed lifecycle API.

## Choose the Middleware Type

Use this table to match the behavior you need with the correct middleware family.

| Need | Middleware Type | Changes Real Execution |
|---|---|---|
| Redact event payloads | Sanitize-request or sanitize-response guardrail | No |
| Normalize tool arguments or model requests | Request intercept | Yes |
| Block unsafe or invalid work | Conditional-execution guardrail | Yes, by rejecting |
| Add timing, retries, routing, or fallback | Execution intercept | Yes |
| Wrap streaming model output | LLM stream execution intercept | Yes |

Use the narrowest middleware type that matches the behavior. For example, do not use a request intercept when you only need to hide a secret from exported events.

## Add a Tool Policy

This example adds three behaviors around a `search` tool:

- Redact `api_key` from emitted request events.
- Reject empty queries before execution.
- Measure execution duration.

## Scope Middleware to One Request

Use scope-local middleware when a policy applies only to one request, tenant, experiment, or agent run.

1. Create or receive the active scope handle.
2. Register middleware with the scope-local helper for that handle.
3. Execute tools or LLM calls inside that scope.
4. Let the scope end remove the scope-local registrations automatically.

Use global middleware for process-wide behavior, such as organization-wide redaction. Use scope-local middleware for request-specific policy, such as tenant routing or an A/B test.

## Middleware Registration Families

NeMo Flow exposes the same core middleware families for tools and LLMs:

| Family | Tool Registration | LLM Registration | Changes Real Execution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sanitize request | `register_tool_sanitize_request` | `register_llm_sanitize_request` | No |
| Sanitize response | `register_tool_sanitize_response` | `register_llm_sanitize_response` | No |
| Conditional execution | `register_tool_conditional_execution` | `register_llm_conditional_execution` | Yes, by rejecting |
| Request intercept | `register_tool_request` | `register_llm_request` | Yes |
| Execution intercept | `register_tool_execution` | `register_llm_execution` | Yes |
| Stream execution intercept | Not applicable | `register_llm_stream_execution` | Yes |

Sanitize guardrails affect only the payload recorded on emitted events. Request intercepts affect the real request that reaches the tool or provider. Execution intercepts wrap the callback itself and are only available when the invocation uses managed execution.

Scope-local variants are available through `nemo_flow.scope_local.register_*`, Node.js `scopeRegister*` helpers, and Rust `scope_register_*` functions.

## Validate the Middleware

Run one allowed request and one rejected request:

- The allowed request should return the same business result as before.
- The rejected request should fail before the tool callback executes.
- Subscriber output should show redacted `api_key` values.
- The timing intercept should print once for each executed tool call.

## Debug Middleware Order

Middleware runs by ascending priority inside each middleware family. Families run in this order for managed tool calls:

1. Conditional-execution guardrails.
2. Request intercepts.
3. Sanitize-request guardrails for emitted start events.
4. Execution intercepts and the real callback.
5. Sanitize-response guardrails for emitted end events.

If a later middleware does not run, check whether an earlier conditional-execution guardrail rejected the call or a request intercept raised an error.

## Common Issues

Check these symptoms first when the workflow does not behave as expected.

- **Sanitized data reaches the real tool**: Use a sanitize guardrail only for event payloads. Use a request intercept when the real request should change.
- **Middleware affects unrelated requests**: Register it scope-locally instead of globally.
- **Duplicate names replace behavior**: Middleware names are registry keys. Use stable, unique names for each behavior.
- **Execution intercept never prints**: Confirm that the application uses the managed execute helper and that no guardrail rejected the request.

## Next Steps

Use these links to continue from this workflow into the next related task.

- Use [Middleware](../about/concepts/middleware.md) to review execution order.
- Use [Code Examples](code-examples.md) for direct registration and partial-execution examples.
- Use [Handle Non-Serializable Data](../integrate-frameworks/non-serializable-data.md) if middleware needs to work with framework objects.
