# OpenClaw Plugin Guide

Use the OpenClaw plugin when OpenClaw owns the agent, tool, and LLM lifecycle
that needs NeMo Flow observability. The plugin observes supported OpenClaw
plugin hooks and converts them into NeMo Flow sessions, LLM spans, tool spans,
and marks that the generic NeMo Flow observability component can export as
Agent Trajectory Interchange Format (ATIF) JSON, OpenTelemetry spans, and
OpenInference/Phoenix spans.

This public OpenClaw plugin provides observability support only. It does not
add NeMo Flow security middleware or adaptive optimization behavior to OpenClaw
execution. For middleware-backed behavior, use the patch-based OpenClaw
integration from the NeMo Flow repository.

Use this guide to install the plugin, enable it in OpenClaw, configure telemetry
outputs, verify exported traces, and understand current LLM replay fidelity.

## Requirements

Required:

- OpenClaw `2026.5.6` or newer.
- The OpenClaw CLI available as `openclaw`.

Optional:

- Node.js and npm when installing or managing the package directly.
- A Phoenix instance or OTLP collector when exporting OpenInference or
  OpenTelemetry spans.

## Install

Install the plugin with OpenClaw so OpenClaw can register and manage it:

```bash
openclaw plugins install npm:nemo-flow-openclaw@0.2.0
openclaw gateway restart
```

OpenClaw uses the package `nemo-flow-openclaw` for installation and the plugin
manifest ID `nemo-flow` for configuration. Use `nemo-flow` in
`plugins.allow`, `plugins.entries`, `plugins inspect`, and gateway status
commands.

If you manage OpenClaw plugin dependencies directly in a Node.js project,
install the package with npm:

```bash
npm install nemo-flow-openclaw@0.2.0
```

Installing with npm makes the package available to that project. Use
`openclaw plugins install` when you want OpenClaw to register and manage the
plugin.

## Enable and Configure the Plugin

Add the `nemo-flow` plugin ID to `plugins.allow`, grant conversation hook
access, and place the OpenClaw plugin configuration under
`plugins.entries["nemo-flow"].config`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "allow": ["nemo-flow"],
    "entries": {
      "nemo-flow": {
        "enabled": true,
        "hooks": {
          "allowConversationAccess": true
        },
        "config": {
          "enabled": true,
          "backend": "hooks",
          "plugins": {
            "version": 1,
            "components": [
              {
                "kind": "observability",
                "enabled": true,
                "config": {
                  "version": 1,
                  "atif": {
                    "enabled": true,
                    "agent_name": "openclaw",
                    "output_directory": "./nemo-flow-atif"
                  },
                  "opentelemetry": {
                    "enabled": false,
                    "transport": "http_binary",
                    "endpoint": "http://localhost:4318/v1/traces",
                    "service_name": "openclaw-nemo-flow"
                  },
                  "openinference": {
                    "enabled": false,
                    "transport": "http_binary",
                    "endpoint": "http://localhost:6006/v1/traces",
                    "service_name": "openclaw-nemo-flow"
                  }
                }
              }
            ]
          },
          "capture": {
            "includePrompts": true,
            "includeResponses": true,
            "stripToolArgs": true,
            "stripToolResults": true
          },
          "correlation": {
            "llmOutputGraceMs": 250,
            "recordTtlMs": 600000,
            "maxRecordsPerKey": 32
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This example enables local ATIF export and leaves OTLP exporters disabled until
you point them at a collector or Phoenix endpoint. Remove exporter sections you
do not use, or set their `enabled` fields to `false`.

- `plugins.allow` controls OpenClaw plugin trust and loading. Include
  `nemo-flow` when OpenClaw runs with restrictive plugin settings.
- `plugins.entries["nemo-flow"].enabled` controls whether OpenClaw starts this
  plugin entry.
- `hooks.allowConversationAccess` lets trusted non-bundled plugins receive
  conversation-sensitive hook payloads such as LLM prompts, LLM responses,
  agent finalization messages, and tool payloads.
- `config.enabled` disables or enables the NeMo Flow OpenClaw wrapper without
  removing the plugin entry. `config.backend` currently supports only `hooks`.
- `config.plugins` is the generic NeMo Flow plugin configuration document. Use
  this object to configure built-in components such as `observability`.
- `config.plugins.components[].config.atif` writes ATIF trajectory JSON files.
  Set `output_directory` to the directory where OpenClaw should write files.
- `config.plugins.components[].config.opentelemetry` sends generic OTLP spans to
  an OpenTelemetry collector when `enabled` is `true`.
- `config.plugins.components[].config.openinference` sends OpenInference OTLP
  spans to Phoenix or another OpenInference-compatible collector when `enabled`
  is `true`.
- `config.capture` controls prompt, response, tool argument, and tool result
  capture. Tool arguments and tool results are stripped by default because they
  often contain user data, local paths, tokens, or large payloads.
- `config.correlation` controls bounded in-memory hook correlation. By default,
  the plugin waits 250 ms for a matching `llm_input` after an `llm_output`,
  keeps correlation records for 600 seconds, and keeps at most 32 records per
  correlation key.

Restart the gateway after changing plugin configuration:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Configuration Key Names

The OpenClaw wrapper owns `enabled`, `backend`, `capture`, and `correlation`.
The top-level `plugins` object inside the wrapper is the generic NeMo Flow
plugin configuration document.

:::{note}
OpenClaw wrapper fields such as `includePrompts` and `llmOutputGraceMs` follow
the OpenClaw plugin schema. Fields inside `config.plugins` are NeMo Flow generic
plugin configuration, so they use `snake_case` regardless of language.
:::

Missing observability sections are disabled. Plugin-host validation or
initialization errors degrade the NeMo Flow runtime as a whole, and the status
method reports configured output health from the generic observability
component. See
[Observability Configuration](../plugins/observability/configuration.md)
for the complete `observability` component schema and exporter-specific fields.

## Verify the Integration

Inspect the plugin runtime:

```bash
openclaw plugins inspect nemo-flow --runtime --json
```

This verifies that the plugin package is installed, enabled, importable, and
exposes its config schema. It does not prove that every hook and gateway method
surface is active in a running gateway.

Run an OpenClaw session with the plugin enabled, then verify the configured
sink:

- ATIF: confirm JSON files appear in the configured
  `config.plugins.components[].config.atif.output_directory`.
- OpenTelemetry: confirm spans arrive at the configured OTLP collector.
- OpenInference: confirm spans arrive at the configured OpenInference/Phoenix
  endpoint.

The plugin also registers the `operator.admin` scoped gateway method
`nemoFlow.status`. If your CLI is already paired with admin-capable gateway
access, run:

```bash
openclaw gateway call nemoFlow.status --json
```

Otherwise, pass your normal admin-capable gateway auth options:

```bash
openclaw gateway call nemoFlow.status --token "$OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN" --json
```

If OpenClaw requests a device scope upgrade for `operator.admin`, approve it
through the normal OpenClaw device approval flow and retry the status call.

The status response reports backend state, output health for `atif`, `otel`,
and `openInference`, replay counters, and the latest degraded or unavailable
reason when present.

## Runtime Mapping

The plugin maps supported OpenClaw hook events into NeMo Flow telemetry without
changing OpenClaw execution behavior.

It does not change OpenClaw tool execution, provider routing, policy decisions,
or adaptive behavior.

| OpenClaw hook | NeMo Flow behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `gateway_start` | Touches the replay backend early; session roots still open lazily from session-scoped hooks. |
| `gateway_stop` | Drains open sessions, shuts down subscribers, and clears the NeMo Flow plugin host. |
| `session_start` | Opens or aliases a NeMo Flow session scope. |
| `session_end` | Closes the session and flushes pending replay state; the generic observability component exports ATIF when enabled. |
| `model_call_started` / `model_call_ended` | Records provider timing for later LLM span correlation. |
| `llm_input` / `llm_output` | Replays direct LLM spans when request and response hooks can be paired safely. |
| `before_message_write` | Records assistant turns for ordered LLM replay when provider timing can be paired later. |
| `after_tool_call` | Replays successful tool calls as tool spans; blocked tools emit marks. |
| `agent_end` | Emits an agent lifecycle mark, flushes recorded assistant-turn LLM spans, and preserves the final assistant answer as the session output. |
| `before_agent_finalize` | Preserves the last assistant message as fallback session output and emits a lifecycle mark without mutating the finalization payload. |
| `subagent_spawned` / `subagent_ended` | Emits subagent lifecycle marks under the best available parent or child session. |

## LLM Replay Fidelity

OpenClaw currently exposes request, response, message-write, and provider
timing details through separate hook events. The plugin correlates those events
within the same session, provider, model, and run.

When model timing cannot be safely paired with an assistant turn, the plugin
emits diagnostic marks instead of inventing latency. This keeps traces honest
and makes current fidelity boundaries explicit.

When OpenClaw provides usage data, the plugin maps input, output, total, cache
read, cache write, and cost fields into OpenInference-friendly usage fields.

## Troubleshooting

If the plugin does not load:

- verify the package was installed with `openclaw plugins install`
- verify `plugins.allow` includes `nemo-flow`
- verify `plugins.entries["nemo-flow"].enabled` is not disabled
- restart the gateway after config changes

If conversation payloads are missing:

- verify `hooks.allowConversationAccess` is enabled for the plugin
- verify the OpenClaw session emits the relevant LLM, message-write, and tool
  hooks

If tool spans exist but LLM spans are incomplete:

- verify `llm_input` and `llm_output` hooks are emitted
- verify `before_message_write` hooks are emitted when relying on assistant-turn
  replay
- verify `model_call_started` and `model_call_ended` hooks are emitted when
  timing attribution is expected
- check diagnostic marks for ambiguous or unpaired timing records

If no export output appears:

- verify `config.plugins.components[].config.atif.output_directory`,
  `config.plugins.components[].config.opentelemetry.endpoint`, or
  `config.plugins.components[].config.openinference.endpoint`
- verify the configured collector or output directory is reachable
- verify session end or gateway stop hooks fired so pending replay state can
  drain

If ambiguous timing marks appear, treat them as expected conservative behavior.
The plugin avoids attaching unsafe latency when multiple timing candidates could
match the same assistant turn.

## Known Limitations

Current OpenClaw public hooks are separate event streams, so some LLM timing
attribution is best-effort. If a matching request hook is missing, the plugin
may replay an LLM output with a placeholder request after the configured grace
window. If timing is ambiguous, the plugin emits diagnostic marks instead of
unsafe latency.
