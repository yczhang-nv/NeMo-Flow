# Subscribers

This page explains how subscribers consume lifecycle events without changing runtime
execution.

## What Subscribers Are

Subscribers are consumers of the NeMo Flow event stream. They receive emitted
lifecycle events and use them for observation, forwarding, export, or analysis.

## How Subscribers Relate to Events

Events describe what happened. Subscribers are the components that watch those
events.

That separation matters:

- The runtime can emit one canonical event stream
- Many subscribers can consume that same stream
- Observability behavior stays downstream from execution semantics

## Registration Levels

Middleware and subscribers can be registered at different levels depending on their
lifetime and visibility.

### Global Subscribers

Global subscribers remain active process-wide until they are removed.

### Scope-Local Subscribers

Scope-local subscribers are owned by one active scope and disappear when that
scope closes.

### Plugin-Installed Subscribers

Plugins can install subscribers as reusable, configuration-driven runtime
components.

## What Subscribers Consume

Subscribers consume the canonical event stream. They do not define the event
model. They react to it.

This lets plain subscribers, exporters, and tracing adapters share one runtime
source of truth.

## Common Subscriber Roles

Subscribers are commonly used for in-process observation, counters, debugging, and
exporter handoff.

### In-Process Observation

Some subscribers stay inside the process and power custom logging, analytics, or
debugging logic.

### Forwarding and Export

Some subscribers translate the event stream into external formats or transport
it to another system.

### Analytics and Diagnostics

Some subscribers derive measurements, trajectories, or diagnostics from the
event stream without affecting execution behavior.

## Built-In Subscriber Examples

These examples show how built-in subscriber patterns relate to custom subscribers and
exporters.

### Custom Subscribers

A plain custom subscriber is the right choice when you want in-process handling
of the canonical event stream.

### ATIF Exporter

The ATIF exporter collects lifecycle events and emits trajectory artifacts for
offline analysis, replay, or debugging.

### ATOF JSONL Exporter

The ATOF JSONL exporter writes the canonical event stream to a native
filesystem path as one raw ATOF event per line. It is available for native
Rust, Python, Node.js, Go, and C FFI use. It is not exposed in WebAssembly
because arbitrary filesystem writes are not portable there.

### OpenTelemetry Subscriber

The OpenTelemetry subscriber maps runtime events into OTLP traces for tracing
backends.

### OpenInference Subscriber

The OpenInference subscriber maps runtime events into OTLP traces using
OpenInference semantics for model-centric observability.

Detailed setup, configuration, and API shape for these subscribers belongs in
[Export Observability Data](../../export-observability-data/basic-guide.md)
and [Observability Code Examples](../../export-observability-data/code-examples.md).

## Practical Guidance

Use these practices when applying the concept in application or integration code.

- Use a plain subscriber when you want in-process custom behavior.
- Use a scope-local subscriber when the observation should disappear with the
  owning scope.
- Use a plugin-installed subscriber when the behavior should be reusable and
  config-driven.
- Use an exporter-oriented subscriber when the event stream should leave the
  process.
