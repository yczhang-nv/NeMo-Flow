# Known Issues

This page lists current limitations and support notes for the release documentation set.

## NeMo Flow 0.2

These notes apply to the NeMo Flow 0.2 Release.

- Go, WebAssembly, and the raw C FFI surface are experimental and source-first.
- Generated API pages cover Rust, Python, and Node.js. Experimental bindings do not yet have the same generated documentation depth.
- The NeMo Flow CLI is experimental. Coding agent observability support varies due to capabilities of hooks. Any encountered problems should be filed as bugs.

### Fixed issues from NeMo Flow 0.1:
- Enabled TLS support for OTLP HTTP export.
- Preserved Go scope stacks across OS threads.
