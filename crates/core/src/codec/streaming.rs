//! Streaming response codecs for the managed LLM execution pipeline.
//!
//! [`crate::codec::traits::LlmResponseCodec`] decodes a complete provider response into a
//! normalized [`AnnotatedLlmResponse`]. For streaming providers, the analogous job is to:
//!
//! 1. consume per-chunk events as they arrive on a streaming HTTP response, and
//! 2. assemble a single non-streaming-shape JSON payload at end of stream.
//!
//! Once assembled, the payload can be fed back through the matching
//! [`crate::codec::traits::LlmResponseCodec`] to produce an [`AnnotatedLlmResponse`] — meaning
//! streaming and non-streaming requests converge on the same observability output without
//! per-route shape duplication.
//!
//! [`StreamingCodec`] is the trait that bundles the two functions
//! ([`LlmCollectorFn`],
//! [`LlmFinalizerFn`]) used by
//! [`crate::api::llm::llm_stream_call_execute`]. Each provider supplies one impl whose internal
//! state holds whatever incremental information is needed to materialize the final payload.
//!
//! [`AnnotatedLlmResponse`]: crate::codec::response::AnnotatedLlmResponse

/// `collector()` and `finalizer()` produce owned closures that share the codec's internal
/// accumulation state. Implementations typically wrap that state in `Arc<Mutex<...>>` so each
/// `&self`-produced closure captures a clone of the handle.
///
/// [`LlmFinalizerFn`] is `FnOnce`, so a [`StreamingCodec`] instance is single-use: callers
/// construct a fresh instance per managed-lifecycle call and discard it after the stream
