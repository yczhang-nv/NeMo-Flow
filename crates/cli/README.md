# nemo-flow-cli

`nemo-flow-cli` is the coding-agent gateway CLI for NeMo Flow observability.
It installs the `nemo-flow` binary, which can configure supported coding-agent
hooks, run agents through an ephemeral gateway, and diagnose local agent and
exporter readiness.

The CLI is a Rust package in this repository, but most users should interact
with the installed `nemo-flow` command rather than link against the crate.

## Why Use It?

- 🧭 **Observe existing coding agents**: Run Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or
  Hermes through a local NeMo Flow gateway without changing the agent itself.
- 🛠️ **Configure hooks interactively**: Use the setup wizard to write project or
  user config and install the hook files needed by supported agents.
- 📡 **Export local sessions**: Write ATIF trajectory files, ATOF event JSONL
  streams, or OpenInference spans from one shared config model.
- 🩺 **Diagnose the machine**: Check config layers, agent binaries, hook status,
  observability outputs, and shell completions with `nemo-flow doctor`.

## What You Get

- ✅ **`nemo-flow` binary**: The executable installed by the `nemo-flow-cli`
  Cargo package.
- ✅ **First-run setup**: Bare `nemo-flow` launches setup when no config exists,
  then runs doctor once config is present.
- ✅ **Agent shortcuts**: `nemo-flow claude`, `nemo-flow codex`,
  `nemo-flow cursor`, and `nemo-flow hermes` start observed agent runs.
- ✅ **Config-driven launch**: `nemo-flow run` resolves config, environment, and
  CLI overrides for deterministic non-interactive use.
- ✅ **Hook forwarding server**: A local gateway accepts agent hook events and
  provider-shaped OpenAI or Anthropic requests.

## Installation

Install the CLI from a repository checkout:

```bash
cargo install --path crates/cli
```

That command installs the binary as:

```bash
nemo-flow --version
```

For local development, build and test the package directly:

```bash
cargo build -p nemo-flow-cli
cargo test -p nemo-flow-cli
```

## Getting Started

Run the first-time setup wizard:

```bash
nemo-flow
```

After setup, inspect local readiness:

```bash
nemo-flow doctor
```

Run a supported agent through the gateway:

```bash
nemo-flow codex
nemo-flow claude -- "summarize this repository"
```

Use `run --dry-run` to inspect resolved config without spawning the agent:

```bash
nemo-flow run --agent codex --dry-run
```

## Configuration

Project config lives at `./.nemo-flow/config.toml`; user config lives at
`~/.config/nemo-flow/config.toml` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nemo-flow/config.toml`.
The project layer overrides system config, and the user layer overrides the
project layer.

Exporter config uses nested per-backend tables:

```toml
[exporters.atif]
dir = "./atif"

[exporters.atof]
dir = "./atof"
mode = "append"
filename_template = "{session_id}.jsonl"

[exporters.openinference]
endpoint = "http://localhost:6006/v1/traces"
```
