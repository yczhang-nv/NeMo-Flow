# NeMo Relay Python Bindings

This crate builds the native extension behind the public Python package
`nemo-relay`. It connects Python applications to the Rust NeMo Relay runtime
through PyO3 and Maturin.

Most Python users should install the Python package rather than depend on this
crate directly.

## Why Use It?

- 🧩 **Bridge Python to the shared runtime**: Connect Python applications to the
  Rust NeMo Relay runtime without reimplementing runtime semantics in Python.
- 🛠️ **Build through standard Python packaging**: Use the repository
  `pyproject.toml`, Maturin, and PyO3 to produce the native extension behind
  `nemo-relay`.
- 🔁 **Keep binding behavior aligned**: Expose the same scopes, middleware,
  plugins, lifecycle events, and adaptive helpers used by the rest of NeMo Relay.

## What You Get

- ✅ **Native extension**: The compiled `nemo_relay._native` module used by the
  public Python package.
- ✅ **Runtime APIs for Python**: Access to scopes, tool calls, LLM calls,
  middleware, subscribers, plugins, typed helpers, codecs, and adaptive helpers.
- ✅ **Shared Rust semantics**: Python behavior backed by the same runtime
  contract as the Rust crate.
- ✅ **Local development path**: `uv sync` builds the editable package and native
  extension from the repository root.

## Installation

Install the published Python package:

```bash
uv add nemo-relay
```

If you are not using `uv`, install it with `pip`:

```bash
pip install nemo-relay
```

For local source development from the repository root:

```bash
uv sync
```

## Getting Started

Import the public Python package and create a scoped runtime boundary:

```python
import nemo_relay

with nemo_relay.scope.scope("demo-agent", nemo_relay.ScopeType.Agent) as handle:
    nemo_relay.scope.event("initialized", handle=handle, data={"binding": "python"})
```
