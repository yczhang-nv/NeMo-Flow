# nemo-relay-plugin

Python authoring SDK for NeMo Relay out-of-process dynamic worker plugins.

Install this package in the Python environment used by a worker manifest with
`load.runtime = "python"`, then expose a `module:function` entrypoint that calls
`serve_plugin`.

```python
from nemo_relay_plugin import Json, PluginContext, WorkerPlugin, serve_plugin


class PolicyPlugin(WorkerPlugin):
    plugin_id = "acme.policy"

    def register(self, ctx: PluginContext, config: Json) -> None:
        async def tag_tool_request(tool_name: str, args: Json) -> Json:
            await ctx.runtime.emit_mark("acme.policy.tool_request", {"tool_name": tool_name})
            if isinstance(args, dict):
                return {**args, "policy": "checked"}
            return {"value": args, "policy": "checked"}

        ctx.register_tool_request_intercept("tag_tool_request", tag_tool_request)


async def main() -> None:
    await serve_plugin(PolicyPlugin())
```

Set `load.entrypoint` to `your_module:main` in `relay-plugin.toml`. Relay
imports that function and awaits the returned coroutine when it starts the
worker process.

The SDK owns gRPC serving, JSON envelope conversion, callback dispatch,
continuations, host runtime calls, and local scope-stack binding. Its private
protobuf bindings are generated from the canonical Relay schema while the
package is built; they are included in installed wheels but are not committed
to the source repository. Installing the published wheel never requires
`protoc` or `grpcio-tools`.

## Callback Concurrency

The gRPC AsyncIO server can keep multiple RPCs in flight. Callback execution is
cooperative: asynchronous callbacks overlap only when they yield control at an
`await`. Synchronous callbacks and synchronous stream iterators run on the
worker event-loop thread. Blocking I/O, `time.sleep`, or long-running CPU work
in those callbacks stalls all worker RPCs. Wrap blocking work in an
asynchronous callback and offload it with `asyncio.to_thread()` or another
appropriate executor.

The SDK does not configure `maximum_concurrent_rpcs`, so gRPC does not enforce
an application-level RPC admission limit.

## Invocation Cancellation

Relay assigns every unary and streaming callback an invocation ID. The host
sends `CancelInvocation` when its managed caller is cancelled, its worker RPC
times out, or it stops consuming a worker-backed stream. The SDK cancels the
matching `asyncio.Task` and reports a structured `worker.cancelled` result.

Cancellation is idempotent. The first request that matches an active callback
returns `accepted = true`; requests for unknown, completed, or already
cancelled IDs return `accepted = false`. Treat acceptance as confirmation that
the SDK found and cancelled the task, not as proof that arbitrary user code has
stopped.

Python task cancellation is cooperative. Async callbacks should allow
`asyncio.CancelledError` to propagate and use `try`/`finally` for cleanup.
Synchronous callbacks run on the event-loop thread and cannot be preempted by
task cancellation. A blocking synchronous callback can delay both the
cancellation RPC and all other worker RPCs, so offload blocking work and make
its own cancellation behavior explicit.

`grpc-v1` workers are expected to implement this best-effort cancellation
contract. Relay remains compatible with older workers that return
`accepted = false`; in that case it still drops the transport request, but it
cannot guarantee worker-side interruption.

Windows ARM64 is not currently supported because `grpcio` does not publish a
usable wheel for that platform. The NeMo Relay workspace skips installation and
tests for this SDK on Windows ARM64 rather than creating a package without its
required gRPC runtime.
